		Families play a crucial role in everyone's life. No matter how big or tiny your family is, as long as you have one,
		that's all that matters. A child's first school, where they learn about numerous subjects, is their family. 
		Only one's family can provide them with the fundamental information about their culture and identity.
		To put it another way, you represent your family. All of a person's good manners and habits come exclusively from their family.
		Being raised in a household that has helped me become a better person makes me feel really fortunate. 
		Families, in my opinion, are a vital component of who we are.</font></p>
		
		<p align="justify"><font face="times new roman" size="3" color="black">
		My family has always supported me through good times and bad. They have shown me how to develop as a person. My parents and sister make up my family.
		My strength is found in each member of my family. My mother is my pillar of strength because I can always rely on her for a sympathetic ear. She is the one person who truly believes in me. 
		She serves as our family's foundation. For the benefit of his family, my father is someone who will always keep his problems hidden. He has shown me what true strength is.
		</font></p>
		
		<p align="justify"><font face="times new roman" size="3" color="black">
		My sister is one of my closest friends and someone I can always rely on. My family gives me the ability to keep pushing myself to reach higher goals.
		In conclusion, I will always be grateful to my family for everything they have done for me. Without them, I just cannot fathom my existence. They were both my first professors and closest pals.
		They are in charge of making my house a safe and secure place for me. With my family, I can tell them anything since they never judge one another.
		We really think that love can overcome all other forces, and this belief motivates us to support one another in improving ourselves as people.
