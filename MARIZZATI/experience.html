					<p align="justify"><font face="minion web" size="3" color="black"> In the beginning of November 2021, I started my first job as a Customer Assistant
					at Watsons Bentong, Pahang. It was a great experience for working at retail store. Im so glad that Watsons Bentong's Team was very helpful and 
					easy-going. Working in retail store were not easy actually but Im proud that I survived with the team. Plus, I learned and did so many things such as stock take,
					arranged stocks in planogram and being a cashier.</font></p>
					
					<p align="justify"><font face="minion web" size="3" color="black">At the end of February, I had an opportunity to continue my degree and planned to quit from the job.
					3 days before I quit, Bentong's Team had a party for me which they brought some food from Marybrown and we had them together. I am so blessed to worked as a family with them.
					Besides that, with an open heart, I still want to work with them and decided to do a part time job there during my semester break. Lastly, I inserted a picture in the "view" button of me and my Bentong's Team 
					during my last shift.</font></p>
